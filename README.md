# :whale: DOCKER-PIRATE :whale:
Some of my Docker projects with multiple tools and technologies. <br>
This repository covers a general understanding of Docker DevOps practices from development to production. <br>

## DOCKER BASICS :anchor:
This repository covers the theory and basic concepts of Docker applications, good practices and some cool examples. <br>
If you want to explore more advanced Docker concepts, or have any question related to this repo, feel free to email me and I will be happy to 
answer you with my best try. <br>

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) <br>
Docker is an amazing revolutionary tool. It is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. <br>
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. <br>
The best place to learn Docker basics is the official [Docker Start-guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), where you can find amazing videos 
and useful documentation for sample projects and best practices. <br>
To explore Docker in further detail, my advice is to start reading the sections of interest from the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com). <br>


The information of this repository is based on many online tutorials, so feel free to use it as a guide for your future projects!.<br>

## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:
The dependencies are explained in detail for each project, but the most important one is Docker (regardless your operating system). <br>
My advice is to primary understand the way Docker works with basic tutorials, and then try to develop amazing project ideas integrating Docker tools!. <br>


### Software dependencies (based on project)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <br>
Visual Studio Code is my main code editor for high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and GitHub easily. <br>

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) <br>
Python is an amazing dynamic programming language that let us work fast, with easy and powerful integration of different software solutions. <br>

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) <br>
NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine programming language. The community is amazing and lets us handle async functionalities in elegant ways. <br>


### Libraries and Package dependencies (based on project)

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) <br>
Flask is an amazing minimalistic micro web framework written in Python. It lets us develop simple-medium level applications "one drop at a time". <br>

* [Express](https://expressjs.com) <br>
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. <br>

* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) <br>
MySQL Database Service is a fully managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications. We will use it via the official [MySQL Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql).<br>

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) <br>
MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers. We will use it via de official [MongoDB Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo). <br>


## Usage :dizzy:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose and I/O. <br>
I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible. <br>


## Special thanks :gift:
* Thanks to my friend Juan Felipe Becerra Ospina for introducing me to DevOps practices. <br>
* Thanks to all contributors of the great OpenSource projects that I am using. <br>
