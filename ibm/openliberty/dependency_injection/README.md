The implementation of the application and its services are provided for you 
in the *start/src* directory. <br> 
The system service can be found in the 
*start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system* directory, and the inventory 
service can be found in the 
*start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory* directory. <br>
If you want to learn more about RESTful web services and how to build them, 
see Creating a RESTful web service for details about how to build the system 
service. The inventory service is built in a similar way.
